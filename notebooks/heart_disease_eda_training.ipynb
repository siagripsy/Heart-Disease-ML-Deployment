These roles can involve extreme physical stress, long hours, and exposure to dangerous environments.\n",

        "On the other hand, the MLP model showed much higher recall for the positive class, which means it is better at identifying individuals who may actually have heart disease. Although it produces more false positives, this behaviour is often acceptable in medical contexts, where failing to detect a real positive case can be far more harmful than incorrectly flagging someone for additional tests. In practice, this model could be used as a second-stage risk-detection system or as part of a digital health platform that alerts users when their lifestyle or health indicators suggest elevated risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the models demonstrate how machine learning can help support early detection, reduce the burden on healthcare resources, and potentially improve patient outcomes. While these models should not replace medical professionals, they can serve as valuable decision-support tools that enhance awareness, improve screening efficiency, and provide an additional layer of insight in real-world healthcare environments.\n"

        "\n",
        "During this project, one of the main challenges I faced was dealing with the highly imbalanced dataset. The positive class (individuals with heart disease or a previous heart attack) represented less than ten percent of the total population, which makes many models perform poorly on detecting high-risk cases. My first attempts using standard methods such as class weighting did not fully solve the issue, especially for models like MLP that do not directly support class weights. I addressed this by oversampling the minority class in the training set, which significantly improved the model’s sensitivity to positive cases.\n",

        "#### 🟩 b) Insights Gained from Applying the Methods\n",
        "\n",
        " First, I learned how model performance can change dramatically depending on the class distribution of the dataset. Even a model with almost 90 percent accuracy can be ineffective if it fails to identify high-risk individuals. This made me appreciate the importance of evaluating models using metrics that match the real-world goal of the application.\n",
        "\n",
        "I also gained a better understanding of how ensemble methods and neural networks behave differently. Random Forest was strong in overall accuracy and stability, while the MLP model, after balancing the training data, became much more effective at detecting positive cases. This showed me that different models can serve different purposes, and that choosing a model should depend on the specific requirements of the real-world problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, this project improved my understanding of the overall machine learning workflow: from data exploration and preprocessing, to handling imbalance, to model training and evaluation. Each step influenced the next one, and I realized how important it is to approach the project in a structured and iterative way. Overall, the experience helped me develop a clearer and more practical view of how machine learning methods can support real-world decision-making.\n"
